## File Generation Tool

#### Purpose

To allow users to create multiple files at once, with a simple UI, either based on an existing list or based on user input.

#### Usage

Select the use mode and proceed to fill in any information that is asked within the fields.

#### Additional Info

I made this project because I did not want to spent 70 seconds to create 12 .cpp files so naturally I thought creating a more long term solution that took multiple hours would be the more logical approach.
